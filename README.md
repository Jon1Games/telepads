This plugin adds Telepads which are a 3x3 multiblockstructure. The multiblockstructure builds it self when the telepads item (`/telepad:giveBuildItem`) is placed.
It provied an interface where it can be:
1. pickupped
2. upgraded (2 Level are available at the time)
3. configured permissions (for usage, settings are owner only)
4. Name edited (minimessage for formatting)
5. set a custom block for the display

## More features
